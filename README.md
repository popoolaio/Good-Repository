1. **Improved Documentation:** The README.md file now provides detailed information on the repository, installation, usage, and notes.
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions:** The naming conventions used in the repository are consistent.
3. **Implemented Testing:** The tests directory contains a test file with proper unit tests for the utility functions.
